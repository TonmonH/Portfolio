            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Tonmon Hossain, I am 34 years old and live in Vestby. In 2012 I moved to Norway from Stockholm. Since I came to Norway, I have worked in Asko Sentrallager in Vestby. Given that I love
                standing in front of a PC, I quickly learned IMI system in my spare time and this led to better opportunities where I started to train new and also old ASKO employees. Now after 10 fantastic years in Asko, I have decided to become a front-end developer, that's why I'm takes course in Noroff to become a front-end developer.</p>

            <h4 class="inner-header"><u><span style="text-decoration:underline #dcff7d" >Warehouse
            </span></u></h4>
                <p>I started working in the picking/tobacco department. Considering
                     that I like to spend time on the computer, I learned the IMI system relatively quickly in my spare time
                      and soon after that I was given responsibility to teach new and also old ASKO
                     coworker.</p>
            <h4 class="inner-header"><u><span style="text-decoration:underline #dcff7d" >Sales/Order handling
            </span></u></h4>
                <p>I was responsible for ComHem products in the store. I
                    arranged exclusive promotions by negotiating with
                    the head of the department and also arranged exciting competitions for
                    store employees to increase sales.</p>
            <h4 class="inner-header"><u><span style="text-decoration:underline #dcff7d" >Customer service/Helpdesk
            </span></u></h4>
                <p>
                    Started work as technical support, where I helped
                    customers who had problems with broadband, television, telecom and then try to 
                    resell something they didn't have. Shortly after that I got promoted to helpdesk where I mostly helped
                    my colleagues with technical questions.</p>
